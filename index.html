          the architecture of the town.

          Learning is something that I do everyday in order to be up-to-

        <h3>
          As almost everyone I enjoy a good challenge to keep pushing for my
          limits. I believe that those are very important moments to learn
          about yourself and your capability of improving.

          In the end of the projects it is very rewarding looking back and see all

          I have practised artistic gymnastics in

            Sport Club do Porto
            </a>
          for 8 years. 
          </h3> <h3>
          So most of my childhood was spent between gym training and competing and the
          middle school.
          </h3>  
          <h3> However I had an injury in my knee so I had to quit gymnastics at the age of
          14.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            One of my favorite sport is equitation 🐎, that I was able to practise despite my injury. <br>
            </h3><h3>
            I did it for 5 amazing years before I went to college and fully focused on my studies. 
         </h3> <h3>
          To sum up, I love sports in general and for me any sport is a way to
          relieve the stress, meet people, and have healthy habits!
